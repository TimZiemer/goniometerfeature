# goniometerfeature
The goniometer is an acoustic feature for stereo audio analysis and music information retrieval.

A goniometer is used in recording studios to monitor aspects of the stereo sound field, such as panning, the stereo width, and mono compatibility. Goniometers are helpful for mixing and producing music, audio drama, podcasts, etc. It consists of two meters. 1.) the phase scope showing a point cloud that represents the stereo distribution, comparable to Lissajous figures from phase space diagrams. 2.) the channel correlation which is indicated as a bar graph. Music producers and audio engineers have their own philosophy concerning the perfect look of the goniometer, depending on the audio material they mix. Consequently, the goniometer can serve to classify music genres, to describe mono compatibility or the reverberance of audio signals, to tell apart dialogue scenes from action scenes in movies and audio drama, and much more... 

The provided code quantifies the two meters and extracts them for multiple frames from a list of audio files. In addition to the audio feature extraction, the extracted features are written into a CSV-file.
